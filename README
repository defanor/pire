Pire (aiming to become *Pi*-forall's *re*factorer) builds upon Stephanie
Weirich's Pi-forall.

Pi-forall's original source code is included to facilitate development
(the code is just copied though, ie. Pire is not a Pi-forall branch
currently, to keep it simple).

There is a clear distinction between Pi-forall original source code, 
and Pire's own code (only few modifications have been made so far), 
and some naming conventions were thus established:

 * The files in the src directory NOT STARTING WITH "Re" (for
   refactoring), are Pi-foralls original source code files (and as
   such covered by their original license, University of
   Pennsylvania).

 * The ones in the src directory STARTING WITH "Re" are Pire's own
   source code, covered by the same kind of license, University of
   Kent).

But other files are copied from Pi-forall's source code as well
(eg. in the test and samples directories), or modified from
Pi-forall's original files (pire.cabal eg.). Tests are for Pi-forall's
original code only currently, but are planned for pire as well.

Some code snippets were used from other sources still:

 * notably the functions for layout parsing from the Idris source
   code,

 * as well as the xslt*.rnc (RelaxNG grammar files) for the docbook
   documentation from Norman Walsh 
   (https://github.com/ndw/xslt-relax-ng).

At this time Pire merely offers a different parser for
for Pi-forall.

Please find further documentation in the docs directory.
