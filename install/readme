Installation is explained in further details in the docs.

The files in this directory are just used a reminder for
me:

* which packages I installed from debian (starting with deb-),

* and which from haskell via cabal: hs-*

* some packages formerly installed by hand, are now installed
  automatically as dependencies: auto-*

* some packages I find nice to have for development,
  but are not strictly required: maybe-*, nice-*

* etc.

I tend to use debian (testing) packages as much as I can, and only
install via cabal what I don't find in debian, or what
doesn't meet my version requirements.

Naturally these dependencies are changing with debian changing,
as well as hackage.

And by the way, I use similar naming conventions: 

* to take some notes: note-*

* or to keep some now obsolete file still around for a while:
  obs-*

These are both are excluded via .gitignore.
